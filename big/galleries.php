<h1>BIG Project Research #2: Galleries</h1>
<p>Barbara Pronsato,  2/9/2020</p>

<p>There are many different types of galleries to choose from. First letâ€™s start by defining what a gallery is. A gallery is a way to display images on a website that offers a dynamic way to interact and view them. A very simple tab Gallery, where there are clickable thumbnails at the top of the page that select the image to view. 


Html:


CSS:


<p>You can also get slider/gallery plugins made with jQuery. Here are a few of the better ones. Blueberry: An experimental opensource jQuery image slider plugin made especially for fluid/responsive web layouts. All in One that comes in: Banner, Rotator, Thumbnails Banner, Banner with Playlist, Content Slider and Carousel. FlexSlider: fully responsive jQuery slider. There are also CSS only galleries that are simple and beautiful. 

Luckily these days you can get out of the box solutions without having to reinvent the wheel, when it comes to displaying images beautifully. </p>
